# Interaction files should be in the format:
# chrom_1	start_1	end_1	chrom_2	start_2	end_2

# There should be no header in the file
# The file names should end with the suffix ".interactions"

# The naive and primed pluripotent stem cell datasets (cohesin chia-pet) are from:
# 3D Chromosome Regulatory Landscape of Human Pluripotent Cells

# The ENC* files are files that I've processed using Mango (see the mango_pipelines directory -- this can be used to recreate these files, although they may differ a little depending on the version of Mango).  I used version 1.1.7
